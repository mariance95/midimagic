This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## MIDI MAGIC

A simple webapp that sends a midi message to your midi controller to lighten up leds :)

```bash
It sends message to either the selected Note or to All of the notes (128)
```
This project is still in development and needs A LOT of work, a lot of refactoring is yet to be made.

Any pull request are welcomed.

## Future features:
- Adding different maps for different controllers (Currently made for a AKAI APCmini MKII, but will basically send to any controller as long as it work as the APCmini)
- Adding color picker
- Adding MIDI device selector (Im busting my brain off)
- Sending MIDI sequences for colorful shows :)

Be free to use, replicate, duplicate or reuse anything inside.

Its my first official project that I personally needed.
